# JAVA_Serialization_project-demo
This is my fully worked HotelManagementProject using Java serialization for converting the state of a Java object into a sequence of bytes. This byte stream can be stored in a file, a database, or transmitted over a network, and later reconstructed back into a live object with the same state. The reverse process is called deserialization.
